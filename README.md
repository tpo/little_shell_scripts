## Little useful shell scripts

Here's the --help for each shell script:

### 7ze

	usage: 7ze file [archive.zip]
	
	    Add 'file' to AES256 enctrypted archive.
	    If the name of the archive is not given then
	    'file.zip' will be used as archive name.
	
	    Archive with file encrypted in this way should
	    be compatible with windows.
	
	    7ze will ask for the password.
### ansible-playbook-with-vault

	usage: ansible-playbook-with-vault [ansible_parameters]*
	       ansible-playbook-with-vault --help
	
	   will check if there's a ansible.cfg in the same
	   directory that the script has been called that
	   contains a line:
	
	       #vault_password_file = ansible/vault/file
	
	   and if it does will:
	
	   * `export ANSIBLE_VAULT_PASSWORD_FILE=ansible/vault/file`
	   * call ansible-playbook with all the parameters given on
	     the command line
	
	   The idea of this script is to work with vault_password_files
	   on a team, where not everybody has vault_password_files
	   set up.
	
	   So those that *have* vault_password_files set up can
	   add the respective comment line as shown above to the
	   ansible.cfg file and have ansible-playbook use that
	   automatically.
	
	   Note that:
	
	   * this way different vault_password_files can be set up
	     per ansible repo
	   * those in the team that do use vault_password_files need
	     to have them located at the same place
	
### ansible-vault-rgrep

	usage: ansible-vault-rgrep [-H] directory [GREP_PARAMS]
	       ansible-vault-rgrep --help
	
	   Recursively grep ansible vault files.
	
	   -H    prefix each match with the filename
	
	   You should either set `DEFAULT_VAULT_PASSWORD_FILE`
	   or set `vault_password_file` in your ansible
	   config file, otherwise ansible-vault-rgrep will
	   be hardly useful.
	
### bash_aliases

	These bash_aliases need to be called from ~/.bashrc or similar like this:
	
	    . /path/to/this/bash_aliases
	
	They provide the following commands:

	    df        - execute "df -h"
	    du        - execute "du -h"

	    hl        - page shell history
	    pg        - grep processes
	    rgl       - rgrep regex | less
	    rgp       - execute "rg --color=ansi | less -R"
	    rgpc      - execute "rg --color=ansi -C 25 | less -R"
	    aps       - execute 'ansible-playbook setup.yml'
	    apst      - execute 'ansible-playbook setup.yml --tags='
	    apsv      - execute 'ansible-playbook setup.yml \
	                         --vault-password-file ~/vault_from_gpg_agent.py
	    apstv     - execute 'ansible-playbook setup.yml \
	                        --vault-password-file ~/vault_from_gpg_agent.py \
	                        --tags='
	
	    apt-find file - say which Debian package contains "file"
	                    needs apt-file
	
	Shortcuts to put firefox, chrom(e|ium) or thunderbird to rest.

### brightness

### bromium

	usage: bromium [--enable-cookies] [--userdir /path/to/userdir] [URL]
	       bromium --help
	
	    Run chromium with an empty temporary profile
	    or with a given directory.
	
	    By default bromium will run in "incognito"
	    mode. If you want to allow cookies then
	    use --enable-cookies
	
	    If you are using bromium as a privacy tool
	    then you may want to consider changing your
	    default search provider. See
	    https://stackoverflow.com/a/50888866
	
	    --enable-cookies  - do not run in incognito mode
	
	    --userdir $DIR    - run from a given user directory. This
	                        can be used to prepare a specific
	                        configuration for a specific application
	                        and then use that directory only for that
	                        application.
	                        When run with --userdir, cookies will
	                        be *enabled*.
	
	    How to prepara a special userdir:
	
	    1. terminate all chromium browser
	    2. move your original chromium configuration to the side
	       `mv ~/.config/chromium ~/.config/chromium.your-original-config`
	    3. start chromium
	    4. configure whatever you need
	    5. terminate chromium
	    6. move the config to the side
	       `mv ~/.config/chromium ~/.config/chromium.my-special-config`
	    7. restore your original config
	       `mv ~/.config/chromium.your-original-config ~/.config/chromium`
	    8. now you can use your special config with bromium
	       `bromium --userdir ~/.config/chromium.my-special-config $SOME_APPLICATION_URL`
